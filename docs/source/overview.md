# Robotics and Autonomous Systems

Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and other disciplines to design, build, and operate robots and autonomous systems capable of performing tasks without human intervention.

## Description

Robotics and Autonomous Systems involve the creation and use of robots that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These systems are designed to operate in a variety of environments, from manufacturing floors to outer space, and can be used for tasks ranging from simple repetitive actions to complex decision-making processes.

## Applications

- Manufacturing and assembly lines
- Healthcare and surgery
- Autonomous vehicles (drones, self-driving cars)
- Space exploration
- Agriculture and farming
- Military and defense
- Search and rescue operations

## Processes/Key Principles

- Sensing and perception
- Motion planning and control
- Machine learning and artificial intelligence
- Human-robot interaction
- Robot kinematics and dynamics
- Embedded systems and real-time computing

## Algorithms

- Path planning algorithms (A*, Dijkstra's)
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Computer vision algorithms (object detection, image segmentation)
- Machine learning algorithms (neural networks, reinforcement learning)
- Control algorithms (PID control, model predictive control)
